I have been watching the Big Bang Theory several times since middle school. In the TV series, the characters have mentioned tons of scientific facts. I am going to include some topics in this post.

# A

## Archenemy
Yes, my archenemy. The Dr. Doom to my Mr. Fantastic, the Dr. Octopus to my Spider-Man, the Dr. Sivana to my Captain Marvel. It's amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees. Graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out. (S02E02)

## Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics
- A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 
- A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 
- A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. (S01E03)

## Astrology
For the record, "that psychotic rant" was a concise summation of the research of Bertram Forer, who in 1948 proved conclusively through meticulously designed experiments that astrology is nothing but pseudo-scientific hokum. (S01E16)

# B

## Bed
It's culturally universal. A bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders. (S01E07)

# C

## Chain of Causality
I really think we should examine the chain of causality here. Event A: ... Event B: ... Query: On what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events? That may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause, which is you think with your penis. (S01E01)

## Coincidence
This would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence. (S01E04)

## Commendation
You are a lucky man. You are talking to one of the three men on the western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought. (S01E05)

## Culinary Science 

### Sandwich
In a proper sandwich, the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. (S01E14)

### Starch
Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion. (S01E17)

### Thai Food
Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century. Interestingly they don't put the fork in their mouth. They use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth. (S01E02)

# D

## The Doppler Effect
It's the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer. (S01E06)

## Driving
Studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating, talking on a cell phone, or drinking coffee while driving reduces one's reaction time by the same factors as an ounce of alcohol. (S02E05)

## Dynamics of Bacterial Growth
Anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket. (S01E04)

# E 
# F
# G

## Guinea Pigs
I need some guinea pigs. Okay, there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you could try, but if your research is going to have human applications, may I suggest white mice instead? Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours. (S01E08)

## Gastronomically Redundant
We can't have Thai food. We had Indian for lunch. They're both curry-based cuisines. It would be gastronomically redundant. (S01E01)

# H

## Hot-Air Blowers
I had to sanitize my hands because the university replaced the paper towels in the restrooms with hot-air blowers. Hot-air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence. Frankly, it would be more hygenic if they just had a plague-infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry. (S02E04)

# I

## Influenza
If influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear, it would have died out thoussands of years ago. Somewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilis would have figured out how to kill the guy with the runny nose. (S01E11)

# J

## Jokes
There's this farmer, and he has these chickens but they won't lay any eggs, so he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations, and he says, "I have a solution, but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum." (S01E09)

# K

## Kiss
Look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss, no change in respiration, pupils undialated, no flushing of the chest. Her jaws are clenched, no tongue access, clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans. (S02E01)

# L

## Light
If you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double-slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. (S01E01)

## Lock
That Baldwin lock on your door uses a traditional edge-mounted cylinders, whereas teh key for your Volkswagen uses a center cylinder system. (S02E03) 

# M

## Manushya Yajna
Excuse me, but isn't hosting guests an aspect of Manushya Yajna, one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder? (S02E01)

## Mead
The tavern girl serving flagons of mead. Her costume was obviously germanic, but in 1487, the Bavarian purity laws, or Reinheitsgebot, severely limited the availability of mead. At best, they would have had some sort of spiced wine. The flagons would not have been made of polypropylene. (S02E02)

# N

## Non-Newtonian Fluid
It's just corn starch and water. They make up a non-Newtonian fluid, which is liquid, but solid under the percussive action of the speaker. (S02E03)

# O
# P

## Poncho
A serape is open at the sides. A poncho is closed. (S01E04)

## Princess Panchali
"Forgive me, your highness, for I am but a monkey and it is in my natrue to climb. I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair." You are the living embodiment of the beautiful Princess Panchali, a beloved character from an Indian folktale. The resemblance is remarkable. I can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair. It was said that the gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips. (S01E08)

## Proverbs Disagreement

### When one door closes, another one opens.
No, it doesn't, not unless the two doors are connected by relays or there are motion sensors involved, or if the first door closing creates a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door. (S01E04)

### The key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition. 
With certain obvious exceptions, suicide, for example. (S01E08)

### It wouldn't kill us to meet new people. 
For the record, it could kill us to meet new people. It could be murders or the carriers of unusual pathogens. (S02E04)

# Q

## Quotes
When I was 11, my sister bought our father a 'world's greatest dad' coffee mug, and frankly the man coasted until the day he died. (S02E04)



# R

## Ratio
You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy? This is a single-decker hamburger, whereas the Big Boy is a double-decker. This has a much more satisfying meat-to-bun-to-condiment ratio. (S01E05)

## Red
Statistically, red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other color. (S02E05)

## Register
You might want to speak in a lower register. Evolution has made women sensitive to high-pitched noises while they sleep so that they will be roused by a crying baby. If you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower register. (S01E02)

# S

It's just a privilege to watch your mind at work. (S01E01)

A homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what? (S01E06)

As I have explained repeatedly, unlike you, I don't need validation from lesser minds. No offense. Maybe I didn't go to college when I was 11 like you, maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16, but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room. No offense. (S01E09)

Obviously you are not suited for three-dimensional chess. Perhaps three-dimensional candy land would be more your speed. (S01E11)

Today, I went from being Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, to, you know, the other guy. Antonio Salieri? Oh, god, now even Howard is smarter than me. (S01E12)

What are you gonna do, just give up? Yes, it's what a rational person does when his entire life's work is invalidated by a postpubescent asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die. (S01E12)

You want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition? Would you ask Picasso to play pictionary? Would you ask Noah Webster to play boggle? Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play go fish? ...

You hypocrite, Little Miss Grown-Ups-Don't-Play-With-Toys. If I went into that apartment right now, would I not find beanie babies? Are you not an accumulator of care bears and my little ponies? And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts? Hello, Hello Kitty. (S01E14)

How exactly would one measure a sense of humor? A humormometer? (S01E15)

Why don't you just tell them that I am a toll-taker at the Golden Bridge? A rocket scientist. How humiliating! (S01E15)

They were clever, Leonard. They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing. (S02E01)

Sheldon, can I ask you a question? I would prefer that you not, but I won't go so far as to forbit it. (S02E01)

You thought the opposite of "stupid loser" was "community college graduate"? (S02E01)

Don't turn it off. You might miss your call from the Nobel committee letting you know you've been nominated as dumb-ass laureate of the year. (S02E03)

If I had a million guesses, I never would have gotten that. (S02E04)

## Schrodinger's Cat
In 1935, Erwin Schrodinger, in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Physics, he proposed an experiment, where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time. Now, since no one knows when or if the poison has been released, until the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead. (S01E17)

## Second Street
Here is a fun question. Do you know what the most common street name is? The answer is tricky. It's second street. You see, you'd think it would be first street, but in most towns, first streets eventually gets renamed to something else. You know, like main street, broad street, Michigan Avenue. (S02E05)

## Secret Keeping
I'm sorry, but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. You can't impose a secret on an ex post facto basis. Secret keeping is a complicated endeavor. One has to be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial expressions, autonomic reflexes. When I try to deceive, I myself have more nervous tics (ticks) than a Lyme disease research facility. (S02E01)

I can't keep your secret, Penny. I'm going to fold like an energy-based de novo protein in conformational space, like a Renaissance tryptich, like a cheap suit. (S02E01)

## Spot
In the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer, it's directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide as to create a parallax distortion. (S01E01)

## Stairs
If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimeters, most people will trip. (S01E01)

## Supernova
A ball of hot, flaming gas that collapses upon itself. (S02E04)

## Superstitions
There's a tribe in Papua, New Guinea, where a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village, and they kill him and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin. Superstitious nonsense, of course, but one can see their point. (S02E04)

# T

## Teleportation
Here's the problem with teleportation. Assuming a device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have actually transported the individual. You would have destroyed him in one location and recreated him in another. (S01E12)

## 30 under 30 to Watch
30 visionaries under 30 years of age to watch as they challenge the preconceptions of their fields. (S02E04)

# U
# V

## Virgin Cuba Libre
I'll have a virgin cuba libre. That's, um, rum and coke without the rum. A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge. (S01E08)

# W
# X

## X-10
The X-10s are online. Gentleman, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP, racing down fiber-optic cable at the speed of light to San Francisco, bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged trans-Atlantic cables, terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the X-10 receiver attached to this... lamp. (S01E09)

# Y

## Fake Yogurt
So you see what you are eating is not technically yogurt, because it doesn't have enough live acidophilus cultures. It's really just ice milk with carrageenan added for thickness. It's also not pink and has no berries. (S02E01)

# Z

## Zodiac Sign
It tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun's apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality. (S01E01)
