# Introduction

All the time I wonder, what skills or knowledge I have learned either on or off campus, what meaningful things I have done during the past three years, and what changes I have made about myself to correct my defects or weaknesses. After this summer break, I will officially become a senior and begin my last ten months at university. It is time to write my own chapter now, and that is why I am setting up this blog, sharing some tips and suggestions to those in need, and also keeping a record of my life, study, interest, coding and so on.

# GitHub Pages

Since I push most of my projects to GitHub, I choose to build a website based on GitHub Pages, along with Hexo and Next, which are totally free. Otherwise, it is necessary to rent a Virtual Private Server (VPS) and pay around $50/year for it, depending on the provider and the service I choose. On GitHub Pages, I just need to create a repository named "USERNAME.github.io" to begin. GitHub Pages is rather easy-to-manage as well. 

> Hosted directly from your [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alfredbowenfeng). Just edit, push, and your changes are live. 

The detailed processes of the setup of github.io, Hexo and Next will be presented in the next article.
