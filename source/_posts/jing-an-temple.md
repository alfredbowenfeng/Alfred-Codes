# Introduction and Available Buildings

Years ago, I saved a gorgeous photo from WeChat Moment, posted by a friend of mine. It was shot right after the rain had stopped, from the top of a crane or by a drone as I guessed. The golden roofs of Jing'an Temple seemed dazzling with the gloomy background.

**Simple Idea: Since San Francisco Bay Area is called 'Bay Area' for short, let's just say Jing'an Temple Area can be called 'Temple Area' for short.**

With a deep feeling about my hometown (Temple Area and West Nanjing Road), I was motivated by the wonderful weather recently, to climb the buildings around Jing'an Temple and shoot photos from a bird's eye view. On Tuesday, one of my closest friends [Enkai](https://enkaiji.com) and I agreed on a trip today. 

There are quite a few buildings around Jing'an Temple of which we can overlook it at the top. However, if we want to shoot photos directly at it instead of being sepatated by the glass walls, there are only a few available buildings that we can climb. Normally, the management crew will not allow unauthorized people to go to the terrace, so we must sneak to the top. 

Here is a map of Jing'an Temple and the buildings around it.

Here are the buildings that we have tried today: Universal Mansion, Jing'an Gaohe Mansion, and Paramount Metropolis. 环球世界大厦、静安高和大厦、百乐门大都会。

# Universal Mansion 环球世界大厦
Firstly, we tried going to the terrace of Universal Mansion. As you can see on the map, Universal Mansion is located at the back of Jing'an Temple. We took a lifter to the 30th floor. The lifter could reach 32nd floor (Construction Bank), but we want to attract as least attention as possible. Consequently, we stopped at 30th floor (a fitness center and a SPA house), and continued going up through the stairs. 

There are two staircases and two entrances on the 30th floor. We took the one near the fitness center at first, and went upstairs to 34th floor. The door was locked, but we could see the terrace from the small holes on the door. Fortunately, there are two staircases. We went downstairs to 30th floor, and took the other staircase (near the SPA house). This staircase led to 35th floor on which we assumed would be the security room. Both of us were excited the moment we found the door on the 34th floor was not locked, so we went outside to the terrace. 

On the terrace are ventilation tubes, central air-conditioning external units, a water tank and so on. Also, there was a security room on the 34th floor as well, and I saw through the window a security personnel sitting on a chair and playing his mobile phone. Thanks to the loud noise made by central air-conditioning external units, he did not hear us opening the door. Then we walked along the edge to the other side. 

Stand by the grey wall when the bird mocks, the last light of 19th July shines upon Jing'an Temple. Tora! Tora! Tora!

# Jing'an Gaohe Mansion 静安高和大厦
Secondly, we tried Jing'an Gaohe Mansion. We took the lifter straight up to the 30th floor (the top floor) and went up through the stairs. Disappointed, we found that there was only one staircase and the door was locked. 

We had to walk downstairs from the 30th floor to the ground because it was during the off-duty-time. The lifters coming to the top were full of people who would rather occupy positions in the lifter although going up first. 

According to [Enkai](https://enkaiji.com) who has went out to the terrace before, sometimes people from the security room may forget to lock the door. After opening the door we can see a security room. If we bypass it quietly enough, the guards will not notice anything. After going outside, to reach the edge, we must go through a narrow beam, below which is the height of five floors (not dangerous but quite risky). 

# Paramount Metropolis 百乐门大都会
Thirdly, we tried Paramount Metropolis, where the highest floor the lifter could reach is the 22nd floor. The lifter required swiping a guest card before use. Luckily, a real hotel guest was going to the top floor, so we followed her into the lifter. As normal, we took the stairs to the top. 

There was a CCTV monitor pointing right at the corridor which we must walk along, and we must have been seen by the guards of the building. A security personnel came up to the terrace several minutes later. 

We took full advantage of the limited time. Here is the view of Jing'an Temple from the terrace of Paramount Metropolis.

We reached the edge of the terrace, where on the ground people could see like the following.

From the terrace, the big character 樂 looked like the following. I took a picture of [Enkai](https://enkaiji.com), but before he could take one for me, the security personnel arrived and asked us to leave. Irritated, we had an argument with him and tossed him off. Just kidding. Well-behaved as we are, we went downstairs immediately.

# Universal Mansion Again
Last, we went up to Universal Mansion again, but this time, we happened to run across a guard when we were walking upstairs to the 34th floor. Abort! Abort! Abort! 

The patrol of the guards will only be more strict and frequent, so if you want to experience the tour and enjoy the amazing scenery of Jing'an Temple by yourself/yourselves, take a risk and break the rules. (Totally worth it)
