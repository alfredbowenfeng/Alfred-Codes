# Rational Analysis
The performance of my 2013 MacBook Air (1.3GHz Intel Haswell 2-core CPU, 8GB 1600MHz Memory and 256G Flash Storage) seems poor when I run MS Office or process data through Jupyter Notebook. Besides, right now I need a PC that 1. has a strong performance, 2. can be GPU-boosted during deep learning, 3. has a larger storage, and with a bigger screen. 

I have been using Mac OS X and macOS for many years since middle school, and I have already got used to the convenience of UNIX and its friendly developing environment. Naturally, buying another Apple first comes to my mind.

## If I buy an Apple MacBook Pro
If I spend ￥25,000 which is approximately $4,000 on a 2018 15-inch MacBook Pro, I will get a PC with the following components. 
{% table %}
| Type | Information |
| --- | --- |
| CPU | Intel Core i7 2.6GHz - 4.3GHz |
| GPU | AMD Radeon Pro 560X (GDDR5 4GB) |
| Memory | 16GB 2400MHz DDR4 |
| Flash Drive | 1TB |
| Screen | 15-inch 2880 x 1880 |
{% endtable %}

The new 2018 MacBook Pro is equipped with a strong CPU (also an Intel Core i9 option) and a gorgeous screen, but the cooling system are not satisfying. 

## If I buy an Apple iMac Pro
If I spend ￥39,150 which is approximately $6,000 on a 2018 27-inch iMac Pro, I will get a PC with the following components. 
{% table %}
| Type | Information |
| --- | --- |
| CPU | Intel Xeon 8-core 3.2GHz - 4.2GHz |
| GPU | AMD Radeon Pro Vega 56 (GDDR5, 8GB) |
| Memory | 32GB 2666MHz DDR4 |
| Flash Drive | 1TB |
| Screen | 27-inch 5120 x 2880 |
{% endtable %}

It looks perfect, though the CPU, GPU, Memory, Flash Drive storage are the least expensive options to choose from. However, the nearly $6,000 price is overwhelmingly expensive; the 27-inch 5120 x 2880 screen is too much for me as well. 

## If I build a PC myself
Building a PC is quite easy and costs far less money, but I haven't got used to the Windows operating system. However, I can install two operating systems in the future if needed. Consequently, after the rational analysis of what I really need and how much I can spare to purchase a new computer, I decide to build a PC myself, instead of purchasing a new Apple. 

# Selection of Components
Here is a list of the components I have bought, and the places from which I bought them. I bought them during the JD and Taobao 618, so the present prices of the components may be different.

Here is a photo of all the components before assembling!

## Case: [Corsair 380T](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id=547294873153)
When starting building a PC, the first thing that one should consider is the case, whose size is most important. There are four types of motherboards, from the smallest to the largest, Mini-ITX, Macro-ITX, ATX and Extended-ATX. The later selection of the motherboard depends on the size of the case I choose. 

I am extremely fond of the cubic-like small cases. I felled in love with the white Corsair 380T the moment I saw it on Taobao. Mini-ITX motherboards are the only ones that can fit into Corsair 380T case. 
![Case](/images/pc-build/case.jpg)

## Power Supply: [Corsair RM550](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id=547287297902)
Since I was buying a Corsair case from [the official Corsair shop](https://mshdc.tmall.com) on [Taobao](https://www.taobao.com), why not buying a stable power supply from it as well? 
![Power Supply](/images/pc-build/power-supply.jpg)

Note that the power supply is extremely important. Some manufacturers use cheap materials on cheap power supplies, which is highly likely to cause unnecessary trouble in the future. Therefore, a quality-guaranteed power supply is pivotal. 

Apart from that, the fan of the Corsair power supply does not start spinning until the power output reaches 225 Watts. The power supply is totally soundless unless I play some video games, boosting TensorFlow with GPU and so on. 

Also, I chose the RM-series modular power supply instead of the VS-series non-modular one, because it would be a lot easier to clean up wires and cables in the small case. 

## Motherboard: [Gigabyte Aorus B360N](https://item.jd.com/22133683591.html)
As is mentioned above, only Mini-ITX motherboards can fit into the Corsair 380T case. Besides, I intend to install an Intel Core i7 8700 CPU on the motherboard, whose socket is LGA1151 and which is recommended to use a B360 motherboard.

Asus motherboards are extravagant. MSI motherboards are said to have many small problems when installing Ubuntu. Consequently, I have chosen the Gigabyte Aorus B360N, which supports LGA1151 and is a Mini-ITX. There is a [package](https://item.jd.com/22133683591.html), including a Gigabyte Aorus B360N and an Intel Core i7 8700 on [JD](https://www.jd.com).
![Motherboard and CPU](/images/pc-build/motherboard-cpu.jpg)

## CPU: [Intel Core i7 8700](https://item.jd.com/22133683591.html)
The reason I bought a 8700 instead of a 8700K was that it seemed pointless to use a 8700K without the need of [overclocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overclocking).

## Memory: [G.Skill Aegis 2400MHz 16GB](https://item.jd.com/2776671.html)
G.Skill memories are popular due to their stability, quality and expensive materials. The motherboard I have chosen has two memory slots that each supports at most 16GB 2666MHz memories, but I only bought one 16GB 2400MHz memories. In the future if it is not enough, I can always buy new ones, because memories sticks are rather convenient to upgrade. 
![Memory](/images/pc-build/memory.jpg)

## GPU: [Gigabyte GeForce 1080](https://item.jd.com/3076376.html)
A graphic processor is vital. Its strong performance with a relatively lower price accounts for most of the reason I build my PC instead of buying an Apple. 

Ranking via performance of NVIDIA GPUs, there are Titan V, Titan Xp, GTX 1080Ti, GTX 1080, GTX 1070Ti and so on. Keeping a balance from its performance and its cost, I decided to buy a GTX 1080 produced by Gigabyte.
![GPU](/images/pc-build/gpu.jpg)

## SSDs and HDD
Different storage media play different roles due to their different functions. SSD (NVME) is fastest but most expensive. Therefore, I installed Windows 10 along with various applications in it. SSD is fast as well, but its SATA3 is slower than M.2 used by SSD (NVME). HDD is slowest but much cheaper, and that is why I stored all my files (documents, images, videos and so on) in HDD. 

### SSD (NVME): [Samsung 960 250GB](https://item.jd.com/3739097.html)
250GB is enough for installing any operating system. I have installed Windows 10 in this SSD. 
![SSD (NVME)](/images/pc-build/ssd-nvme.jpg)

### SSD: [SanDisk Plus 240GB](https://item.jd.com/1398969.html)
240GB is also enough for installing any operating system. I have installed Ubuntu 18.04 as well as the applications in this SSD. 
![SSD](/images/pc-build/ssd.jpg)

### HDD: [Seagate 2TB 7200rpm](https://item.jd.com/3356012.html)
HDDs are cheap. Now I have a 2TB HDD. In the future if it becomes insufficient, I can always substitute one with larger storage for it. 
![HDD](/images/pc-build/hdd.jpg)

## Cooling System
An efficient and quiet cooling system is essential. Not only does it determine the performance of the computer, it also affects the user's experience with the computer. That is why I chose a Noctua CPU fan and a Noctua system fan installed at the back of the case, as well as two LL120 fans at the front. 

The optimal airflow duct recommended on the official Corsair Web pages is "front in, back out". 
![Airflow](/images/pc-build/airflow.png)

### CPU Fan: [Noctua NH-L9i](https://item.jd.com/2247748.html)
As it is a Mini-ITX motherboard, I have to choose a CPU fan that will not block the memories. 
![CPU Fan](/images/pc-build/cpu-fan.jpg)

### System Fan (Back): [Noctua NF-F12](https://item.jd.com/2248359.html)
I do not need a RGB lighting effect for the back of the case, so I have chosen a Noctua fan for the back. 
![System Fan (Back)](/images/pc-build/system-fan-back.jpg)

### System Fans (Front): [Corsair LL120 Pack](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.5-b-s.w4011-16299423831.94.5c6a29c1WGNnR0&id=562879344524&rn=f7e2bd2a4435d26134a14836e5f04473&abbucket=16)
Corsair LL fans provide spectacular lighting effects but make only a little noise. My case Corsair 380T only supports two LL120 fans at the front. Although expensive, they are totally worth the price. 
![LL120 Pack](/images/pc-build/system-fans-front.jpg)

## Others
When building the PC, I encountered several problems. 
- The screws included in the LL120 package do not fit the case. 
- There are only two system fan ports on the motherboard, while I have installed three system fans. 

Therefore, I bought [eight screws](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.12132e8dbLI6dL&id=549607519799&_u=m28lcb4u2232) and a [three-on-one wire](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.12132e8dbLI6dL&id=565793412559&_u=m28lcb4u4206).

# Assembling and Building
I refer to the following video tutorial when assembling and building my PC. If you are in China Mainland and do not have access to YouTube, alternatively you are able to watch [this tutorial on bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av14248027).
